# Open source projects

Nearly all of my projects are open source and public on GitHub. I mostly use the GNU General Public licence v3.0 and the Unlicence for my projects. For text, art, images, videos and other non-code content, I use the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Licence (CC BY-SA 4.0) or the public domain/Created Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) licence.

Some projects may have a different licence, so please check the project's repository for the licence.
