    <p>Welcome to my github page! On this page you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on. Most of my projects are fun projects and experiments that I have made. 90% of all my 
  projects are open source and public on GitHub so feel free to look at them.<p>

> I am in the works of cleaning up my github. Most of my projects are abandonware and there are hundreds of github repos with barely any content. Which is why I am moving scripts and other junk (Yeah I call it that over to my [scraps repo](https://github.com/0x4248/scraps). Some other files like binary files are being put in my JunkDrawer [here](https://github.com/0x4248/junkdrawer).

## Languages I mainly program in

I started programming in python when I was 12 and still use it to this day. Over the course of my programming journey I have learned many other languages.

-   Python
-   C/C++
-   Java
-   JavaScript
-   ~~HTML/CSS~~ (Not a language)
