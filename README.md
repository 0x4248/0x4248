# Heya, Welcome to my GitHub!

This is where I keep a mix of projects, experiments, and random ideas I’ve turned into code. I like to tinker with both **hardware and software**, and most of my experiments revolve around **Linux** setups, scripting, and general nerdy fun.

## 📂 My Main Repos

Here’s where most of my stuff lives:

* **[Notebook](https://n.0x4248.dev)** – My Obsidian notes and research.
* **[Scrapbook](https://github.com/0x4248/Scrapbook)** – Code experiments, scripts and small projects
* **[JunkDrawer](https://github.com/0x4248/JunkDrawer)** – Everything else: binaries, CSVs, images, videos, and other files.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

I started programming in **Python** when I was 12, and it’s still one of my go-tos. Over time, I’ve also worked with:

* Python
* C / C++
* Java
* JavaScript
* ~~HTML / CSS~~ (Not languages)

I also play arround with old languages and systems such as:

* DOS
* Fortran
* C64/128
* Really old UNIX systems
